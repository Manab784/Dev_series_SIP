The designer provides a great approach with no code solutions that help the coders the non coders to work and build models with minimal knowledge.

The blog will give a small example of implementing the model using the designer which provides the drag and drop options for convinient model building and evaluations.

## The dataset

The dataset is a crop with respective price values. We would try to build a model to predict the cotton prices from the given dataset.
Will look at the patterns and relations that it forms with other dataset.

The dataset is available at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kianwee/agricultural-raw-material-prices-19902020).

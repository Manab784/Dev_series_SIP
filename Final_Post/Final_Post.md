# Technology and Climate Crisis: The Green challenges needs solutions

The current challenges are humongous and it is already happening. The [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock) was left updated even to 100 seconds before midnight since 2019. The iconic clock has been the symbol that represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe, and on its 75th anniversary the groupâ€™s experts say weâ€™re closer than ever to that dreadful wakeup call.

Along with the drastic changes that are very predictable but taken casually, there have been challenges with the global food system. It is expected to provide safe and nutritious food to a population that will likely grow from 7.5 billion people today, to nearly 10 billion by 2050. So, we have limited nutrious supply but huge demand by that time. 

There are three challenges â€“ feeding a growing population, providing a livelihood for farmers, and protecting the environment â€“ must be tackled together if we are to make sustainable progress in any of them.

We have to start today, if done late it's absolutely irreverable. The polars ice cap loss, the snowfall in sahara desert, change in water currents are all about the disturbed natural balance and equilibrium.
Infact we know the changes today are transiting towards that phase. We really need to act NOW !

Technology and scientific advancements are also advancing and things are getting better in technology. Cloud paved the way for centralised structure for technology and access to all.

One of the best implementation of such solutions can be powered by the Azure Cloud and with the advancement of prediction capabilities using machine learning and deep learning in the domain of AI.

## The Power of Cloud

 Potential for driving business innovation remains virtually untapped. Indeed, cloud has the power to fundamentally shift competitive landscapes by providing a new platform for creating and delivering business value.
 It has the potential to change the functioning of a society, its working and enviornment.

 Azure is Microsoft Cloud service and one of the best cloud service provider in globe. The azure machine learning provides highly flexible solutions for the present scenario.

**Azure Machine Learning** is a cloud-based service that helps you simplify some of tasks and reduce your time on preparing data, training models, and deploying predictive services. It's provides the end to end service that can help you in computations using powerful servers.

In this blog series, we discuss:

* ***Azure Automated Machine Learning*** 
* ***Azure Machine Learning Designer***
*  ***Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python***.

Let's review these products in general.

### Azure Automated Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

***Azure Automated ML*** is a no-code solution for building your machine learning application.  

It iterates over many combinations of algorithms and hyper-parameters to help you find the best model based on a success metric of your choosing.

Follow ***[How Automated ML helps decide Forest Cover Type?](../Third_Post/Third_Post.md)*** to build your Automated ML application.

* *[Use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/)*

### Azure Machine Learning Designer ðŸ“Ÿ

Designer is used for building machine learning models in a developer friendly interface. The designer helps creating the models by developing a structure using drag and drop interface.

The no code experinece ensures anyone can use the technology even though they are not developers and don't have any coding experience. It provides a straight forward pathway for functioning and implementing models from spliting the dataset to getting the evalutions graphically !!!

#### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python ðŸ’¼

Comfortable in coding? Then use the credentials of these services, for running them in your notebook. That's very handy!

Use any of the services. With all the flexibility and arrangements, it provides the best solutions for these challenges. 


### We need to protect it at all cost ...

This initiative is ours, if we miss our reponsibility of healing earth, we all will be responsible for what comes next. We need to restore though climate positive actions along with small trust and actions towards science.

The healing starts from you !

DO IT NOW, WE STILL GOT SOME TIME !

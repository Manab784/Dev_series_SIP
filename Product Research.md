# Marketing Research

Machine Learning is a comprehensive technology, which requires statistics and programming knowledge. It is a trending technology, too, an eye-catching word. We choose Azure Machine Learning as the product, and research community, audience, and product.

## Community

DEV is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out.

In DEV community, users around the world share their content, including

- Tutorial
- Personal experience
- New idea

Machine Learning is one of Top topics in this community.

## Audience

In this section, we will discuss audience's mindset and their facing problems.

### Mindset

From the posts and comments, we find our audiences have following mindsets:

- embrace new things
- want to learn new things
- willing to share

When it comes to machine learning, they think:

- machine learning is hard to learn, sometimes
- machine learning means well-paid job

### Facing Problem

We collect common problems our audiences face about machine learning:

- How to start machine learning path
- How to master so many algorithms and mathematical knowledge
- How use use these knowledge to solve real world problems

## Product

Our focused product is Azure Machine Learning. It is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle.

Azure Machine Learning provides three options to build and deploy models:

- **Automated ML (UI)**: This is a no-code solution. Automated machine learning rapidly iterates over many combinations of algorithms and hyper-parameters to help you find the best model based on a success metric of your choosing.
- **Designer (drag-n-drop)**: Azure Machine Learning designer is a drag-and-drop interface used to train and deploy models in Azure Machine Learning.

- **Notebooks (Python)**: Notebooks enable you to transfer local workspace to cloud, and easily deploy the model.

## Competitors

- Google
- AWS

From what we've seen, it seems to be a very common trend to pick up new words that we hear all around us and use them in our own conversations to feel updated ! This is very common in the field of technology too !!

Now, to ***really*** update ourselves, we must truly understand what the word means right ? Otherwise, we'd end up using it in pretty awkward situations. With that said, let's have a little talk on one amongst the most busiest words of the 21st Century in the field of technology, shall we ? 

and you guessed it right, its ***Machine Learning***.

## What is Machine Learning ?

***Machine Learning (ML)*** belongs to the field of ***Artificial Intelligence (AI)***, which provides computer systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being manually programmed. It's as if we're building a smaller/scaled down version of the ***human brain*** or a part of it,  thus providing our computer with the ability to think, learn and take decisions on its own.

Now, if you've been in the field for quite sometime, you would have heard of ML and related ***ML Algorithms***. Machine learning uses algorithms to identify ***patterns*** within data and those patterns are then used to create a data ***model*** that can make predictions. With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate—much like how humans improve with more practice.

Okay, all of this seems great right ? So, where's the catch ? 

The catch is when you've got to take immense time and effort in building an ***ML Model***. It's not always easy to gather the required ***Datasets*** to build a model, which equally agrees with the efforts of having to learn various ML Algorithms and choose the best, which then needs further optimization. There is also a lack of apt ***hardware*** on all devices needed to run heavy models and finally, the most important of these problems - Stackoverflow isn't your best friend when it comes to ML Models, as your usecase might be very specific, not commonly found on the internet.

Before we get started with Azure's Machine Learning Services, let's talk a little about ***Azure***.

The ***[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)*** Cloud Platform is more than ***200 products and cloud services*** designed to help you bring new solutions to life—to solve today’s challenges and create the future. It helps you build, run and manage applications across multiple clouds, on-premises and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of your choice.

Amongst the various products and services offered by Azure, the one we're helping you master is called ***Azure Machine Learning Services***.
